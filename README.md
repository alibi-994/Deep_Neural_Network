In this project we aim to construct a deep neural network from scratch. 
In the modules file there is a step by step implementation of the theoritical deep neural network architecture.
The model is the gathering of all the modules in a method to enable it to train itself on the input data and eventually output the optimised parameters of the network.
These parameters are used for the prediction on the new inputs.
This model is a binary classifier.
